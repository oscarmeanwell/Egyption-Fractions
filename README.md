# Egyption-Fractions
Written in Perl5
Uses Fibonacci greedy algorithm to translate rational numbers into egyption fractions

An egyption fraction is the sum of its distinct unit fractions:
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16 = 43/48

This program gets the Egyption fraction of whatever fraction you input.

```
Please input Numerator: 43
Please input Denominator: 48

Egyptian Fraction Representation of 43/48 is: 

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/16
```
